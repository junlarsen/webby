            Ever since I've was young, I've been fascinated with engineering and technology. During my early childhood I
            was obsessed with Lego bricks, which later turned into a love for the video game Minecraft. A few years down
            the line I found myself tinkering with HTML and websites, and eventually I began writing Minecraft server
            plugins.

            Today I'm a full-stack developer experienced in writing expressive web experiences. Some of the tools I work
            with include React, Next.js, TypeScript, Kotlin, PostGreSQL and Terraform. I'm also experienced with
            deploying applications on Amazon Web Services.
